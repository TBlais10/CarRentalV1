# Car Rental CLI

This is a project I took on while in Careerdevs. This was our first
large project tackling CLIs after doing smaller class based 
assignments. We were tasked to create a car rental program, create a login
system, and check cars in and out of the service.
## Installation

Install Car Rental CLI by cloning the repo with Gitbash

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TBlais10/CarRentalV1.git
```
## Usage/Examples

When the CLI is ran, it will start at the main menu and ask for a log in.

```CLI
Welcome to Taylor's Car Rental Service!
Do you have an account with us? Y/N
Or would you like to exit the program? If so, type 'exit'.
Input: 
```

Type 'no' and you will be prompted to create an account:
```CLI
Ok! Lets create a new user for you!
Create your username!
Input: user
Now your password! Should contain a minimum of 8 characters and no more than 20 characters.
Input: password
user
password

---
Welcome user! Thank you for creating an account with us! Please log in to use our program.
---
```

You will then be returned to the login menu and be asked to log in:
```CLI
Do you have an account with us? Y/N
Or would you like to exit the program? If so, type 'exit'.
Input: yes

---
What is your username and password?
---
Username Input: user
Password Input: password

---
Welcome back user
---

```

At this point you will be thrown to the main menu and fully inside the program.
